Review the current uncommitted changes (or the latest commit if clean) for:

1. Spec match — does it solve the intended problem?
2. Security — RLS, Server Actions, client trust, secrets
3. Performance — unbounded queries, N+1, heavy client bundles
4. Design tokens — no hardcoded colors/radius

Return findings as a short checklist with file paths. Do not commit.
